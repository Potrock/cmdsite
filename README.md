# cmdsite
A website designed to look like Command Prompt windows, with user able to type in commands. Will be messing around on this, not really meant for anything.


This will be an ongoing project for me, not sure what I'm going to do with it but for now it will just contain some contact information as if it were going to be a personal site.
As of right now it has buttons instead of a user input field, but that will come soon.
